The DRF, GBM, and GLM models exhibit high accuracy and stability, making them reliable choices for classification tasks. Notably, the XGBoost model excels in Recall and F1 score, indicating its effectiveness in identifying positive cases and maintaining a balance between precision and recall. The GBM model shows a particularly strong performance in terms of AUC, suggesting its robustness in distinguishing between classes. All models were validated on a dataset with an AUC of approximately 0.98, underscoring their high predictive power.


未来的研究方向可以聚焦于验证这些特征的生物学功能，探索它们在临床应用中的潜力，以及研究它们与疾病发生、发展和预后之间的潜在关联。这将有助于深化我们对微生物组在健康和疾病中作用的理解，并可能导致新的诊断和治疗策略的开发。
