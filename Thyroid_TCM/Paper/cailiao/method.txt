2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Collection of Catechin Targets
The isomeric SMILES numbers for the eight catechin components—catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), gallocatechin (GC), epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin gallate (CG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)—were obtained from the PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on 14 July 2024), with their structures illustrated in Figure 2. Subsequently, the predicted targets of catechins were identified using the isomeric SMILES numbers through the SEA Search Server (https://sea.bkslab.org/, accessed on 14 July 2024) and the SwissTargetPrediction (http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/, accessed on 14 July 2024) databases. The predicted targets from the two databases were then merged, and duplicates were removed, resulting in the collection of potential targets for the eight catechin components. Furthermore, the catechin–targets network was constructed and visualized using Cytoscape 3.9.1.

 2.2. Screening of Hypertension-Related Targets
Hypertension-related targets were retrieved from three disease databases: DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/, accessed on 15 July 2024), OMIM (https://omim.org/, accessed on 15 July 2024), and GeneCards (https://www.genecards.org/, accessed on 15 July 2024), using the keyword “hypertension”. The screening criteria were set as a score of gda ≥ 0.1 in the DisGeNET database and a relevance score ≥ 5 in the GeneCards database. The hypertension-related targets from the three databases were then merged, and duplicate targets were removed.
2.3. Screening of Key Targets and Construction and Analysis of the Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Network
To explore the potential targets of catechins in treating hypertension, an intersection analysis was performed between the catechin targets and hypertension targets, and a Venn diagram was generated using the online platform (https://cloud.metware.cn/, accessed on 21 July 2024). The intersecting targets were imported into the STRING database (http://string-db.org/, accessed on 21 July 2024) to construct the PPI network of the target proteins [24]. “Homo sapiens” was selected as the species, and the minimum interaction score threshold was set to 0.4, with other parameters set to default. The network was visualized using Cytoscape 3.9.1 software, and the Network Analysis plugin was employed to calculate the degree value of each target. Key targets were identified based on their degree values, and molecular docking studies were subsequently conducted on the top three key proteins with the highest degree values.
2.4. GO and KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analyses
To further investigate the biological functions of the key target genes, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the “clusterProfiler” package, with a p-value threshold set at p < 0.05. GO functional analysis predicted gene functions across three categories: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF), while KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified key pathways associated with the anti-hypertensive targets of catechins. Both GO and KEGG analysis results were visualized using an online tool (https://cloud.metware.cn/, accessed on 21 July 2024).
2.5. Molecular Docking
The SDF format ligand files for the eight catechin components were obtained from the PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on 23 July 2024), and the three-dimensional structure models of the proteins MMP9 (PDB ID: 1L6J), HIF1A (PDB ID: 4H6J), and BCL2 (PDB ID: 5FCG) were obtained from the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/, accessed on 23 July 2024) [25]. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock Vina 1.2.5 [26], and the docking results were further analyzed and visualized using Discovery Studio 2019 software.
2.6. Molecular Dynamics Simulation
To explore the stability of the protein–ligand interactions in greater depth, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on four complexes: CG-MMP9, GCG-MMP9, ECG-HIF1A, and EGCG-BCL2, using GROMACS 2020.6 software. The AMBER99SB force field and SPC water model were utilized, with the system temperature set at 300 K and the simulation time at 50 ns. The energy minimization phase employed the steepest descent method, followed by energy equilibration to stabilize the system before completing the MD simulation. The binding free energies were calculated using the MM/GBSA method, and the resulting MD simulation data were visualized using Xmgrace software 5.1.25 [27].
