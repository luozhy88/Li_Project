仿照这个下面的话（To comprehensively understand the mechanisms by which catechin components act on hypertension at the system level, KEGG and GO enrichment analyses were performed on the 23 intersecting targets. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the 23 intersecting targets were enriched in 90 signaling pathways (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S5), including the vascular smooth muscle contraction (hsa04270), aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption (hsa04960), renal cell carcinoma (hsa05211), and TNF signaling pathway (hsa04668), among others (Figure 4A). Additionally, the GO enrichment results show that the targets were enriched in 1063 biological processes (BPs), seven cellular components (CCs), and 89 molecular functions (MFs) (Supplementary Table S6, p < 0.05). As illustrated in Figure 4B, in the BP category, the main enrichments were in positive regulation of angiogenesis (GO:0045766), endothelial cell proliferation (GO:0001935), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway (GO:0048010). In the CC category, the primary enrichments were in platelet alpha granule lumen (GO:0031093), platelet alpha granule (GO:0031091), and apical part of cell (GO:0045177). In the MF category, significant enrichments included calcium-dependent protein kinase C activity (GO:0010857), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor binding (GO:0005172), and metalloendopeptidase activity (GO:0004222). The results of the KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analyses suggest that the key targets play important roles in regulating vascular smooth muscle contraction, promoting angiogenesis, and mediating vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling processes.）进行仿写，根据上传的图片进行描述A,B,C，里面有三组ZBM,XKC,XYT,进行对比论述，从图整体来看XYT在大多数条目中占比最高，其次是XKC，ZBM占比最低，说明XYT在功能注释中占比最高，可能在功能上对疾病的影响更大。同时XYT与XKC条目表现呈现相同的趋势，说明这两者在功能上有一定的相似性。



仿照这个下面的话（为了全面了解ZBM、XKC和XYT三组在生物过程中的功能差异，基于GO富集分析结果对三组进行了比较。如图所示，XYT组在大多数条目中占比最高，尤其是在氧化应激反应（response to oxidative stress）、类固醇激素反应（response to steroid hormone）和钙离子稳态（calcium ion homeostasis）等关键生物过程中，XYT组的基因数量显著高于XKC和ZBM组。这表明XYT在这些功能注释中占比最高，可能在调控这些生物过程中对疾病的影响更大。
XKC组在多个条目中次于XYT组，表现出相似的趋势。例如，在营养水平反应（response to nutrient levels）、钙离子转运调节（regulation of calcium ion transport）等过程中，XKC和XYT的基因富集情况较为接近。这表明两者在功能上具有一定的相似性，可能在某些生物过程中发挥类似的调控作用。
相比之下，ZBM组在大多数条目中的占比最低，尤其是在涉及金属离子反应（response to metal ion）和氧化应激反应等过程中，ZBM的基因富集数量明显少于XYT和XKC。这表明ZBM在这些生物过程中的影响相对较小。
总的来说，GO富集分析结果表明，XYT组在大多数生物过程中占比最高，可能对相关疾病具有更大的影响，而XKC与XYT表现出相似的趋势，说明两者在功能上具有一定的相似性。ZBM组则在大多数条目中占比最低，表明其功能影响相对较弱。）进行仿写，根据上传的图片进行描述A,B,C，里面有三组ZBM,XKC,XYT,进行对比论述，从图整体来看XYT在大多数条目中占比最高，其次是XKC，ZBM占比最低，说明XYT在功能注释中占比最高，可能在功能上对疾病的影响更大。同时XYT与XKC条目表现呈现相同的趋势，说明这两者在功能上有一定的相似性。同时关注下关于肿瘤，炎症和增殖相关通路。本部分只是进行结果描述，不进行讨论。

olecular docking was employed to evaluate the binding affinities of four catechin components with three key target genes (MMP9, HIF1A, and BCL2). The results show that the docking scores for the four catechin components with the three targets ranged from −6.2 kcal/mol to −8.9 kcal/mol (Table 1). Lower docking scores indicate stronger binding affinities, with scores < −5.0 kcal/mol indicating potential binding and scores < −7.0 kcal/mol denoting strong binding affinities [28]. For MMP9, CG and GCG exhibited the strongest binding affinities, both scoring −8.9 kcal/mol. For HIF1A and BCL2, the strongest binding ligands were ECG and EGCG, with docking scores of −8.8 kcal/mol and −6.7 kcal/mol, respectively. The reference drug enalapril had docking scores of −7.1 kcal/mol, −6.7 kcal/mol, and −6.0 kcal/mol with MMP9, HIF1A, and BCL2, respectively. Compared to the reference drug enalapril, these significant compounds demonstrated stronger binding affinities to the key targets.
The binding mechanisms between the three key targets and their selected catechin ligands are shown in Figure 5. The binding pockets of MMP9, HIF1A, and BCL2 were tightly occupied by CG, GCG, ECG, and EGCG, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Supplementary Table S7). In MMP9, CG formed hydrogen bonds with LEU39 (2.75 Å), ASP185 (2.61 Å), GLY186 (2.20 Å), ARG51 (2.00 Å), ARG95 (2.69 Å and 2.67 Å), and TYR48 (3.00 Å) and hydrophobic interactions with TYR48 (5.57 Å), LEU39 (5.43 Å and 4.89 Å), and LEU44 (5.21 Å) (Figure 5A). GCG in MMP9 formed hydrogen bonds with ASP182 (2.98 Å), THR96 (2.74 Å), GLY186 (2.50 Å), TYR52 (2.14 Å), ARG51 (2.05 Å), ARG95 (2.60 Å), and TYR48 (2.98 Å) and hydrophobic interactions with TYR48 (5.55 Å), LEU39 (5.41 Å and 4.92 Å), and LEU44 (5.15 Å) (Figure 5B). In HIF1A, ECG formed hydrogen bonds with TYR325 (2.30 Å), LYS465 (2.28 Å), ARG440 (1.94 Å), and VAL464 (2.51 Å) and hydrophobic interactions with PRO360 (4.95 Å), VAL464 (5.49 Å), PRO360 (4.74 Å), LYS328 (4.47 Å), VAL464 (4.32 Å), and PRO360 (5.18 Å) (Figure 5C). EGCG in BCL2 formed hydrogen bonds with VAL117 (2.70 Å), GLU113 (2.89 Å), LYS24 (2.27 Å), ARG28 (2.22 Å), and SER66 (2.53 Å) and hydrophobic interactions with ARG28 (5.12 Å and 3.82 Å), VAL117 (5.38 Å), and VAL120 (5.13 Å) (Figure 5D). These results indicate that catechin components effectively bind to the core targets through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.
To further explore the stability of protein–ligand interactions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on four protein–ligand complexes: MMP9-CG, MMP9-GCG, HIF1A-ECG, and BCL2-EGCG. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were used to assess whether the simulation systems reached a stable state, with RMSD values within 1 nm indicating relative stability of protein–ligand interactions in a physiological environment [29]. As shown in Figure 6A, the RMSD values of the four complexes rapidly stabilized at 0.59 ± 0.16 Å, 0.46 ± 0.12 Å, 0.17 ± 0.03 Å, and 0.24 ± 0.05 Å, respectively. The radius of gyration (Rg) was analyzed to evaluate the compactness of receptor–ligand binding. As depicted in Figure 6B, the Rg values of the complexes remained stable throughout the simulation, stabilizing at 2.46 ± 0.03 nm, 2.42 ± 0.03 nm, 1.78 ± 0.01 nm, and 1.61 ± 0.01 nm, respectively. The solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is an important parameter reflecting protein folding and stability. The SASA values of the four complexes also demonstrated stability, reaching average values of 215.79 ± 2.79 nm2, 218.87 ± 4.42 nm2, 115.76 ± 2.49 nm2, and 99.47 ± 1.90 nm2, respectively (Figure 6C). The number of hydrogen bonds reflects the strength of protein–ligand binding, with MMP9-GCG showing the highest hydrogen bond density and strength, followed by MMP9-CG, HIF1A-ECG, and BCL2-EGCG (Figure 6D).
The binding free energies (ΔGbind) of the four protein–ligand complexes were further calculated using the MM/GBSA method. Lower ΔGbind values indicate stronger receptor–ligand binding affinity [30]. As shown in Figure 6E, the ΔGbind rankings of the four complexes were MMP9-CG (−29.34 kcal/mol) < MMP9-GCG (−27.7 kcal/mol) < HIF1A-ECG (−24.32 kcal/mol) < BCL2-EGCG (−21.89 kcal/mol), which is consistent with the molecular docking results.
